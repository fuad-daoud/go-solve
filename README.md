This Project is to solve problems using go on multipe platforms links to all problms solved/attempted will be listed below, a tag/branch will have the same name as the problem.

For example the problem named *shuffle the array* will have a tag named *shuffle-the-array*.

For example for codeforces problems since they have a letter associated with them this is an example for the problem named *A. My First Sorting Problem* will be *a-my-first-sorting-problem*
